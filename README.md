# DPF---Digital-Playground-Factory

04-04-2017
Take an ADT specification and semi-automatically converted to an interactive, direct-manipulation, visual environment.
The specification should be as close as a JS constructor as possible.

To auto-generate a 2D environment:
	- the constructor can be called and new objects initialized
	- operations can be called upon objects (respecting declared "types")
	- display using defaultView, but view can be changed interactively
	- persistence should be automatically added
